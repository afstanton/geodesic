# Geodesic

**Finding the shortest path between where I am and where I want to be.**

Geodesic is my personal project management and business development system, named after the mathematical concept of the shortest distance between two points. This repository serves as both a planning workspace and development environment for building a sustainable business empire that will ultimately fund molecular nanotechnology research.

## Project Status: Strategic Planning Complete

**Current Phase:** Decision point between two validated SaaS opportunities  
**Documentation:** Comprehensive analysis and implementation plans completed  
**Next Step:** Begin development of chosen application

## The Mission

Transform from unemployed and financially constrained to entrepreneurial independence and beyond - ultimately funding molecular nanotechnology research through a series of successful SaaS businesses built using a modular, systematic approach.

## Current Status

**Point A (Current State):** *See [[docs/Analysis/Baseline]]*
- 56 years old, chemistry PhD (Purdue, 1999) + 20+ years Rails experience
- No current income, negative net worth
- $3k/month current bills + need $6-7k/month for independent living
- **Target: $10k gross monthly revenue by end of 2025**

**Point B (Ultimate Goals):** *See [[docs/Analysis/Long Term Vision]]*
- $1+ billion net worth
- Global location independence (multiple estates)
- Molecular nanotechnology research funding
- Systematic anti-fascism work through addressing root causes

## Strategic Approach

### The SaaS Factory Model *See [[docs/Analysis/SaaS Factory Strategy]]*
Instead of building individual applications from scratch, I'm developing a modular system of Ruby gems and Rails engines that can be combined to rapidly create new SaaS businesses. This approach enables:

- **Faster time-to-market** for new applications
- **Compound improvements** across entire portfolio
- **Technical arbitrage** leveraging advanced analytical skills
- **Systematic scaling** toward wealth targets

### Technical Arbitrage Focus *See [[docs/Analysis/Asymmetric SaaS Opportunities for Advanced Analytics + Rails]]*
My unique combination of chemistry PhD (global optimization thesis) + 20 years Rails experience creates opportunities where advanced mathematical/statistical skills command premium pricing but remain scarce among typical developers.

**Validated opportunities:**
- Marketing Mix Modeling and advanced marketing analytics
- Business Intelligence with sophisticated statistical analysis
- Operations research and supply chain optimization
- Cross-platform integrations requiring deep technical knowledge

## Current Decision Point

Based on comprehensive market research *([[docs/Analysis/SaaS Market Analysis: Marketing Analytics vs Business Intelligence]])*, two specific SaaS applications have been validated:

### Option 1: Business Intelligence SaaS (Recommended)
*See [[docs/Apps/Business Intelligence SaaS]]*
- **Target:** Mid-market companies needing advanced analytics
- **Pricing:** $1,000-3,000/month per customer
- **Timeline:** 3-5 months MVP, 6-12 months full features
- **Advantage:** Faster time-to-market, established pricing models

### Option 2: Marketing Analytics SaaS (Alternative)
*See [[docs/Apps/Marketing Analytics SaaS]]*
- **Target:** Companies with $500k-$5M marketing spend
- **Pricing:** $800-4,000/month per customer  
- **Timeline:** 4-6 months MVP, 12-24 months full MMM capabilities
- **Advantage:** Higher growth potential, stronger competitive moats

## Key Documentation

### Strategic Analysis
- **[[docs/Analysis/Baseline]]** - Current state assessment and challenges
- **[[docs/Analysis/Interim Goals]]** - Short-term objectives through 2025
- **[[docs/Analysis/Long Term Vision]]** - Ultimate billion-dollar wealth targets
- **[[docs/Analysis/SaaS Factory Strategy]]** - Modular development approach
- **[[docs/Analysis/Project Inventory]]** - Analysis of previous incomplete work

### Market Research  
- **[[docs/Analysis/Asymmetric SaaS Opportunities for Advanced Analytics + Rails]]** - Initial opportunity analysis
- **[[docs/Analysis/SaaS Market Analysis: Marketing Analytics vs Business Intelligence]]** - Comprehensive competitive research

### Implementation Plans
- **[[docs/Apps/Business Intelligence SaaS]]** - Recommended faster-to-market option
- **[[docs/Apps/Marketing Analytics SaaS]]** - Alternative higher-growth option

## Current Focus

**Decision Phase Complete:** Business Intelligence SaaS identified as optimal path based on:
- Faster development timeline (3-5 months vs 4-6 months)
- More predictable scaling with established per-user pricing
- Lower technical barriers while still leveraging statistical expertise  
- Clearer path to $10k MRR by end-2025 deadline

**Next Actions:**
1. Finalize technology stack and modular engine architecture
2. Begin MVP development targeting mid-market companies
3. Focus on healthcare/financial services verticals for premium positioning
4. Implement [[docs/Analysis/SaaS Factory Strategy]] for maximum component reusability

## Key Principles

1. **No consulting or contract work** - Building owned assets only
2. **Proprietary technology** - Engines and gems remain competitive advantages
3. **Technical arbitrage** - Leverage advanced skills where others struggle
4. **Modular architecture** - Every component serves multiple future applications
5. **Premium positioning** - Target customers who pay for sophisticated solutions

## Why "Geodesic"?

In mathematics, a geodesic represents the shortest path between two points on a curved surface. In physics, it's the path taken by objects in free fall through spacetime. For this project, it represents the most efficient route from current constraints to ultimate objectives - not necessarily the easiest path, but the optimal one given the terrain.

The name reflects both the analytical mindset from my chemistry background and the systematic approach to building sustainable wealth through technical excellence.

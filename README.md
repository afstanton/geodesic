# Geodesic

**Finding the shortest path between where I am and where I want to be.**

Geodesic is my personal project management and business development system, named after the mathematical concept of the shortest distance between two points. This repository serves as both a planning workspace and development environment for building a sustainable business empire that will ultimately fund molecular nanotechnology research.

## Project Status: Implementation Phase - Building Multi-Tenant Analytics Platform

**Current Phase:** Active development of Apex Analytics Platform with Vantage as flagship implementation.
**Sprint:** Sprint 1 of 6 - Multi-tenant foundation and Quant engine MVP (Weeks 1-2)
**Documentation:** Complete - Technical architecture, sprint planning, and implementation tracking in place.
**Infrastructure:** Rails 8.0.2 applications created, all engine gems scaffolded, Docker configured.
**Next Milestone:** Working MVP with statistical differentiation by Week 6.

## The Mission

Transform from unemployed and financially constrained to entrepreneurial independence and beyond - ultimately funding molecular nanotechnology research through a scalable analytics platform business built using a modular, systematic approach.

## Current Status

**Point A (Current State):** *See Baseline*
- 56 years old, chemistry PhD (Purdue, 1999) + 20+ years Rails experience
- No current income, negative net worth
- $3k/month current bills + need $6-7k/month for independent living
- **Target: $10k gross monthly revenue by end of 2025**

**Point B (Ultimate Goals):** *See Long Term Vision*
- $1+ billion net worth
- Global location independence (multiple estates)
- Molecular nanotechnology research funding
- Systematic anti-fascism work through addressing root causes

## Strategic Approach

### The Platform-First SaaS Factory Model *See SaaS Factory Strategy*
Instead of building individual applications from scratch, I'm developing **Apex Analytics Platform** - a foundational multi-tenant platform that powers both my own applications and white-label implementations for other SaaS companies. This approach enables:

- **Revenue multiplication** - Same platform serves multiple customer bases
- **Faster time-to-market** for new implementations
- **Compound improvements** across entire ecosystem
- **Technical arbitrage** leveraging PhD-level statistical skills at platform scale
- **Platform economics** with network effects and ecosystem growth

### Technical Arbitrage Focus *See Asymmetric SaaS Opportunities for Advanced Analytics + Rails*
My unique combination of chemistry PhD (global optimization thesis) + 20 years Rails experience creates opportunities where advanced mathematical/statistical skills command premium pricing but remain scarce among typical developers.

**White-label market validation** *(White Label Market Analysis & Strategic Assessment)* reveals:
- Current platforms offer only "basic trendlines, aggregates, and filtering"
- **Zero competitors provide PhD-level statistical capabilities**
- 75% of prospects abandon evaluations due to pricing complexity
- Perfect opportunity for transparent, usage-based pricing with statistical differentiation

## Platform Architecture

### Apex Analytics Platform *See docs/Apps/Apex*
The foundational multi-tenant platform that powers all implementations:
- **Target:** SaaS companies needing white-label embedded analytics
- **Pricing:** $950-3,100/month per implementation (transparent, usage-based)
- **Timeline:** 3-4 months platform foundation, 6-9 months full capabilities
- **Key Innovation:** PhD-level statistical capabilities through simple APIs

### Vantage - Flagship Implementation *See docs/Apps/Vantage*
Aaron's own branded BI application built on Apex Platform:
- **Target:** Mid-market companies needing advanced analytics
- **Pricing:** $1,000-3,000/month per customer
- **Strategic Role:** Proof-of-concept and social proof for platform
- **Value Proposition:** *"This platform is so powerful, we built our own $15k+ MRR BI business on it"*

### White-Label Implementations
Additional branded implementations for other SaaS companies:
- Each gets completely separate branding and customer base
- Powered by same statistical capabilities as Vantage
- Transparent pricing addresses market's #1 pain point
- SDK-first architecture enables true native embedding

## Why "Geodesic"?

In mathematics, a geodesic represents the shortest path between two points on a curved surface. For this project, it represents the most efficient route from current constraints to ultimate objectives through **platform economics** - not building individual applications, but creating the infrastructure that powers multiple successful implementations.

The platform approach transforms the geodesic from a single path (one SaaS) to a **network of paths** (multiple implementations) all supported by the same foundational infrastructure, dramatically accelerating the journey to financial independence and beyond.

# Geodesic

**Finding the shortest path between where I am and where I want to be.**

Geodesic is my personal project management and business development system, named after the mathematical concept of the shortest distance between two points. This repository serves as both a planning workspace and development environment for building a sustainable business empire.

## The Mission

Transform from unemployed and financially constrained to entrepreneurial independence and beyond - ultimately funding molecular nanotechnology research through a series of successful SaaS businesses.

## Current Status

**Point A (Current State):**
- 56 years old, chemistry PhD (Purdue, 1999)
- 20+ years Rails development experience
- No current income, negative net worth
- $3k/month current bills + need $6-7k/month for relocation
- Target: $10k gross monthly revenue by end of 2025

**Point B (Ultimate Goals):**
- $1+ billion net worth
- Global location independence
- Molecular nanotechnology research funding
- Systematic anti-fascism work

## Strategic Approach

### The SaaS Factory Model
Instead of building individual applications from scratch, I'm developing a modular system of Ruby gems and Rails engines that can be combined to rapidly create new SaaS businesses. This approach enables:

- **Faster time-to-market** for new applications
- **Compound improvements** across entire portfolio
- **Technical arbitrage** leveraging advanced analytical skills
- **Systematic scaling** toward wealth targets

### Technical Arbitrage Focus
My unique combination of chemistry PhD (global optimization thesis) + 20 years Rails experience creates opportunities where advanced mathematical/statistical skills command premium pricing but remain scarce among typical developers.

Current focus areas:
- Marketing Mix Modeling and advanced marketing analytics
- Business Intelligence with sophisticated statistical analysis
- Supply chain and operations optimization
- Cross-platform integrations and automation

## Current Focus

**Business Intelligence SaaS** - Based on comprehensive market analysis, focusing on mid-market BI with advanced analytics capabilities. Target vertical: healthcare/financial services where statistical expertise commands premium pricing.

**Timeline:**
- MVP development: 3-5 months
- First paying customer: 6-10 months  
- $10k MRR target: End of 2025

## Key Principles

1. **No consulting or contract work** - Building owned assets only
2. **Proprietary technology** - Engines and gems remain competitive advantages
3. **Technical arbitrage** - Leverage advanced skills where others struggle
4. **Modular architecture** - Every component serves multiple future applications
5. **Premium positioning** - Target customers who pay for sophisticated solutions

## Why "Geodesic"?

In mathematics, a geodesic represents the shortest path between two points on a curved surface. In physics, it's the path taken by objects in free fall through spacetime. For this project, it represents the most efficient route from current constraints to ultimate objectives - not necessarily the easiest path, but the optimal one given the terrain.

The name reflects both the analytical mindset from my chemistry background and the systematic approach to building sustainable wealth through technical excellence.

# API Client Builder

**Purpose**: To provide a standardized, repeatable pattern for building robust clients for third-party REST APIs.

**Related To**: [[Data Ingestion Engine]]

## Core Features

- **DSL for API Definition**: A simple DSL for defining API endpoints, their paths, and allowed HTTP methods.
- **Authentication**: Pluggable authentication strategies for API keys, OAuth, etc.
- **Pagination Handling**: Built-in support for common pagination schemes (e.g., page/per_page, cursor-based).
- **Rate Limiting**: Basic rate limiting support to avoid exceeding API quotas.
- **Error Handling**: Standardized error classes for common HTTP errors (4xx, 5xx).

## Technical Design

- A base class (e.g., `ApiClient::Base`) that other clients can inherit from.
- Uses `Faraday` for the underlying HTTP requests.
- Service classes to encapsulate authentication and pagination logic.
- No models or controllers.

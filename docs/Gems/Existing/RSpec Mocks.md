# RSpec Mocks

**URL:** https://rspec.info/documentation/3.12/rspec-mocks/

**Description:** RSpec Mocks is a test double framework that comes bundled with RSpec. It allows you to create mock objects, stubs, and spies to isolate the code under test and control its dependencies.

**Relevance to Geodesic Projects:**
- **Testing Strategy:** Crucial for unit testing and isolating components by controlling external dependencies.
- **SaaS Factory Strategy:** Enables robust testing of individual engine and gem functionalities without relying on the entire application stack.

**Key Features:**
- `double` for creating generic test doubles.
- `allow` for stubbing methods.
- `expect` for setting message expectations.
- `spy` for verifying method calls.
- Integration with RSpec for seamless usage.

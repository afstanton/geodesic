# RubyLLM::Schema

**URL:** https://github.com/danielfriis/ruby_llm-schema

**Description:** `ruby_llm-schema` is a Ruby library for defining and validating schemas for LLM inputs and outputs. This gem will ensure data consistency and integrity when interacting with large language models, especially for structured data extraction and generation.

**Relevance to Geodesic Projects:**
- **MCP Gateway Engine:** Essential for ensuring that data sent to and received from LLMs conforms to expected structures, improving reliability and reducing errors.
- **Statistical Analysis Engine:** Can be used to define schemas for natural language queries and their structured responses, facilitating automated analysis.
- **SaaS Factory Strategy:** Provides a reusable component for robust data handling in LLM-powered features across all applications.

**Key Features:**
- DSL for defining LLM input and output schemas.
- Validation of data against defined schemas.
- Serialization and deserialization of data to/from LLM-compatible formats (e.g., JSON).
- Integration with the [[RubyLLM]] gem.

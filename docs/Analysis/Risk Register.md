| Risk ID | Description                                                                        | Likelihood (1-5) | Impact (1-5) | Score (L*I) | Mitigation Plan                                                                                             | Status   |
| :------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------- | :----------- | :---------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------- |
| 001       | **Market Risk:** A major competitor (e.g., Tableau, PowerBI) adds a robust, statistically-driven white-label offering. | 2                | 4            | 8           | Double down on developer experience and the "PhD-level" statistical capabilities that are hard to replicate. | Active   |
| 002       | **Execution Risk:** The "Previous Project Pattern" re-emerges, leading to stalled progress on the Vantage MVP. | 3                | 5            | 15          | Strict adherence to the weekly goals in [[Current Focus]] and the [[Feature Prioritization]] framework. | Active   |
| 003       | **Financial Risk:** Personal funding runs out before the project reaches the $10k/month revenue target. | 4                | 5            | 20          | Follow the [[Dual Track Strategy]] to generate revenue from Vantage direct sales as early as possible.      | Active   |
| 004       | **Technical Risk:** The complexity of the [[Quant]] engine leads to significant performance issues at scale. | 2                | 3            | 6           | Implement comprehensive performance testing early. Offload complex calculations to background jobs.         | Active   |
| 005       | **Adoption Risk:** White-label customers are interested but find the SDK too difficult to integrate. | 3                | 4            | 12          | Invest heavily in high-quality documentation, tutorials, and a smooth developer onboarding experience.      | Active   |

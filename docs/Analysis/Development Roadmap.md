# Development Roadmap**Purpose**: To outline the phased development plan for building a multi-tenant analytics platform supporting both direct SaaS sales and white-label implementations. This roadmap provides a critical path to achieving the project's [[Interim Goals]] through the [[Dual Track Strategy]].

**Strategic Context**: Based on [[White Label Market Analysis]], the platform will be architected for white-label capabilities from day one while launching direct sales through [[Vantage]].

## Phase 0: Multi-Tenant Foundation (Months 1-3)

**Goal**: Establish core platform architecture supporting both direct customers and future white-label implementations. Architecture decisions made here determine white-label viability.

### Core Platform Infrastructure
-   **Multi-Tenant Application Shell**: Create Rails application with `acts_as_tenant` gem for customer data isolation. Each customer gets separate database schema from day one.
-   **White-Label Architecture Foundation**: Design database models and API structure to support customer branding, custom domains, and embedded components.
-   **Engine Skeletons**: Generate skeletons for all engines ([[Conduit]], [[Quant]], [[Canvas]], [[Sentinel]], [[Aegis]], [[Optimus]], [[Nexus]], [[Synapse]]) with multi-tenant considerations.

### Security & Isolation ([[Aegis]] v0.1)
-   **Multi-Tenant Authentication**: Implement customer-isolated authentication using [[Devise]] with tenant-specific user management.
-   **Customer Data Isolation**: Each customer's data completely separated with unique encryption keys.
-   **Basic API Authentication**: Foundation for future white-label API access.

### Data Processing ([[Conduit]] v0.1)
-   **Tenant-Aware Data Ingestion**: Data sources scoped to specific customers with isolated processing.
-   **Customer-Specific Credentials**: Secure credential storage per tenant using customer-specific encryption.
-   **Multi-Tenant ETL Pipeline**: Foundation for processing customer data in isolation.

### Platform Services
-   **Multi-Tenant Billing** ([[Pay]]): Customer-specific subscription management with [[Stripe]].
-   **Tenant-Scoped Monitoring**: [[Sentry]] integration with customer-specific error tracking.
-   **API Gateway Foundation** ([[Nexus]] v0.1): Basic API structure for future embedding capabilities.

## Phase 1: Direct SaaS MVP + White-Label Preparation (Months 3-6)

**Goal**: Launch [[Vantage]] direct sales while building white-label technical foundation. Prove product-market fit with direct customers while preparing platform capabilities.

### Direct Customer Features
-   **[[Canvas]] (v0.5 - Multi-Tenant Dashboards)**: Customer-isolated dashboards with basic charts using [[Chartkick]]. Foundation for white-label UI components.
-   **[[Quant]] (v0.5 - Statistical Analysis Engine)**: Core statistical capabilities (regression, forecasting) that differentiate from basic BI tools. **Key white-label differentiator**.
-   **[[Conduit]] (v0.5 - Self-Service Data Pipeline)**: UI for customer data source management with tenant isolation.
-   **[[Aegis]] (v0.5 - Customer RBAC)**: Role-based access within customer tenants.

### White-Label Technical Preparation
-   **Component API Design**: Design APIs for future SDK generation and embedding.
-   **Customer Branding Framework**: Database models for custom logos, colors, domains.
-   **Multi-Tenant Testing**: Comprehensive testing strategy for customer isolation.
-   **Developer Documentation Foundation**: Begin API documentation for future white-label customers.

### Revenue Generation
-   **Direct Sales Launch**: Target 3-5 [[Vantage]] customers at $1,000-3,000/month.
-   **Customer Success Process**: Onboarding and support processes for direct customers.
-   **Market Validation**: Validate statistical differentiation and pricing model.

## Phase 2: White-Label Platform Launch (Months 6-9)

**Goal**: Launch white-label capabilities while scaling direct sales. Transform from single SaaS to multi-tenant platform.

### White-Label Core Features
-   **[[Nexus]] (v1.0 - Full API Gateway)**: Complete API for white-label integration with [[Doorkeeper]] authentication and [[Rack-Attack]] rate limiting.
-   **SDK Generation**: JavaScript/React SDK for native embedding of analytics components.
-   **Customer Branding System**: Full white-label customization including custom domains, CSS, and component styling.
-   **Developer Portal**: Self-service onboarding, documentation, and testing environment for white-label customers.

### Advanced Analytics Capabilities
-   **[[Quant]] (v1.0 - Advanced Statistics)**: Confidence intervals, A/B testing analysis, anomaly detection with statistical significance.
-   **[[Canvas]] (v1.0 - Embeddable Components)**: Rich, interactive components designed for native embedding.
-   **[[Sentinel]] (v1.0 - Multi-Tenant Alerting)**: Customer-scoped alerting with white-label notification customization.

### Platform Operations
-   **Multi-Customer Support**: Support processes for both direct customers and white-label partners.
-   **White-Label Onboarding**: Streamlined technical integration process for SaaS companies.
-   **Revenue Tracking**: Multi-tier billing for direct vs white-label customers.

### Success Metrics
-   **Direct Sales**: $5k MRR from 3-5 customers
-   **White-Label Launch**: First 1-2 white-label customers at $950-1,500/month each
-   **Platform Validation**: Prove dual-market approach

## Phase 3: Platform Scale & Specialization (Months 9-12+)

**Goal**: Scale white-label platform while maintaining direct sales growth. Achieve [[Interim Goals]] revenue targets.

### Platform Maturity
-   **[[Synapse]] (v1.0 - AI Integration)**: ML/AI capabilities for both direct and white-label customers using [[RubyLLM]].
-   **Advanced Multi-Tenancy**: Customer-specific environments, advanced isolation, performance optimization.
-   **Enterprise Features**: Advanced security, compliance reporting, dedicated customer environments.

### Market Expansion
-   **Vertical Specialization**: Industry-specific features for healthcare, fintech, e-commerce white-label customers.
-   **Partner Ecosystem**: Integration partnerships with popular SaaS development platforms.
-   **Community Building**: Developer relations and community-driven growth.

### Revenue Targets
-   **Combined Revenue**: $10k+ MRR from mix of direct and white-label customers
-   **White-Label Focus**: 5-10 white-label customers generating $950-3,100/month each
-   **Platform Economics**: Demonstrate superior unit economics vs pure direct sales

# Go-to-Market Playbook

**Purpose:** To provide a specific, actionable playbook for acquiring customers for [[Apex Analytics Platform]] and [[Vantage]] that aligns with a technical and content-driven approach, minimizing traditional sales outreach.

---

## Guiding Principle
Demonstrate value through expertise, not persuasion. Our marketing is to show our work.

## 1. The Content Marketing Engine

**Goal:** Turn development progress into marketing assets that attract our ideal customer profile (technically-savvy leaders).

**Process:**
1.  **Weekly Review:** At the end of each week, review the tasks completed in the [[Current Focus]].
2.  **Identify a Topic:** Select one technical challenge that was solved (e.g., "Implementing tenant-aware caching with Redis," "Building a statistically valid A/B test calculator").
3.  **Draft a Technical Blog Post:** Write a short, practical blog post detailing the problem, the solution, and the code. The post should be a tutorial, not a sales pitch.
4.  **Subtle CTA:** End each post with a simple, low-pressure call-to-action: *"This implementation is part of the Quant Engine for the Apex Analytics Platform. If you're facing similar challenges building embedded analytics, see how we've solved it."*
5.  **Distribution:** Share on technical platforms: Hacker News, relevant subreddits (e.g., r/rails, r/SaaS), and Medium.

## 2. Developer-Centric Engagement (The "Help, Then Sell" Model)

**Goal:** Build relationships with potential white-label customers by providing value upfront.

**Process:**
1.  **Monitor Key Platforms:** Set up alerts for questions on Stack Overflow, GitHub Discussions, and specific subreddits related to "embedded analytics," "multi-tenant rails," or "customer-facing dashboards."
2.  **Provide Genuine Help:** Answer questions thoroughly and provide high-quality, helpful solutions based on the work already done for Apex.
3.  **Introduce Apex (When Relevant):** If the problem is complex, it's natural to mention: *"I actually built a full engine to handle this for a platform I'm working on called Apex. Here's the architectural approach I took..."*
4.  **No Hard Sell:** The goal is to build a reputation as an expert. The right customers will follow the breadcrumbs back to the project.

## 3. The "Vantage as Social Proof" Campaign

**Goal:** Systematically leverage the success of [[Vantage]] to prove the power and reliability of the [[Apex Analytics Platform]].

**Process:**
1.  **Month 4-6 (Post-Vantage Launch):** Write a series of case studies.
    *   **Case Study 1: The Build.** *"How We Built a $5k MRR BI Tool in 90 Days on the Apex Platform."* (Focus on speed and modularity).
    *   **Case Study 2: The Technology.** *"The Multi-Tenant Security Model Behind Vantage: A Deep Dive."* (Focus on security and reliability).
    *   **Case Study 3: The Impact.** *"From Spreadsheets to Statistical Significance: How Vantage's First Customers Are Making Better Decisions."* (Focus on customer value).
2.  **Targeted Sharing:** Share these case studies directly with SaaS CTOs who have been identified through the developer-centric engagement activities.

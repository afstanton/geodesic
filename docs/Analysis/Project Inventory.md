# Project Inventory & Technical Arbitrage Analysis

Foundation: [[Baseline]] | Strategy: [[SaaS Factory Strategy]] | Current Options: [[Business Intelligence SaaS]], [[Marketing Analytics SaaS]]

## The Pattern Recognition
Aaron has identified a crucial pattern:
- **Previous Challenge:** Starting projects but not finishing them
- **Hidden Asset:** Multiple repos with partial gems, engines, and implementations
- **Key Insight:** Technical arbitrage - "things easy for me are difficult for most people"
- **Strategic Shift:** Focus on high-value capabilities others find challenging

## Current Project Portfolio

### Spindlet - Cross-Platform Note Integration
**Concept:** Shared note-taking ("threads") widget living inside other applications
**Technical Approach:** 
- Renders via Google Apps Script, Atlassian Forge, SalesForce Lightning Web Components
- Cross-platform integration architecture
**Blocker:** DSL for rendering needs overhaul
**Status:** Needs rewrite commitment
**Arbitrage Potential:** Cross-platform widget development expertise

### Gaply - Competitive SaaS Analysis
**Concept:** Automated competitive analysis and gap identification for SaaS
**Technical Approach:**
- Collect and analyze competing app features
- Generate comparison matrices for opportunity identification
**Blocker:** Feature normalization into reasonable matrix sets proves difficult
**Status:** Stalled on data structure challenges
**Arbitrage Potential:** Data normalization and competitive intelligence automation

### Ad-Optimizer - Marketing Management with MMM
**Concept:** Multichannel marketing management SaaS
**Key Discovery:** Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) transforms pricing model
- Basic features: $10s-100s/month
- With MMM: $1000s/month justified
**Status:** May return to this
**Arbitrage Potential:** MMM is "obvious" to Aaron but very difficult for most marketers

## Technical Arbitrage Opportunities Identified

### Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM)
- **Aaron's perspective:** "Obvious addition" to marketing tools
- **Market reality:** Most people find it extremely difficult
- **Value multiplier:** 10x+ pricing differential
- **Chemistry connection:** Statistical modeling and optimization expertise

### Cross-Platform Widget Development
- **Aaron's perspective:** Natural technical challenge
- **Market reality:** Complex integration that most developers avoid
- **Value potential:** High-margin recurring revenue from embedded tools

### Competitive Data Analysis & Normalization
- **Aaron's perspective:** Data structure and categorization problem
- **Market reality:** Manual competitive analysis is time-intensive
- **Value potential:** Automation of expensive consultant work

## Strategic Questions for Brainstorming

### 1. Project Selection & Focus
- Which project has fastest path to $3k+/month revenue?
- Which leverages existing work most effectively?
- Which has highest technical arbitrage margin?

### 2. Technical Arbitrage Deep Dive
- What other "obvious to you, hard for them" capabilities exist?
- How can chemistry/optimization background create unique value?
- Which arbitrage opportunities scale best?

### 3. Completion Strategy
- How to break the pattern of starting but not finishing?
- Which project requires least "rewrite" overhead?
- What's the minimum viable version that generates revenue?

### 4. Engine Architecture Integration
- Which project best validates the modular SaaS factory approach?
- What engines would be shared across these projects?
- How to extract reusable components from existing messy code?

## Immediate Decision Framework
Given financial urgency and pattern of incomplete projects:
1. **Speed to Revenue:** Which can generate income fastest?
2. **Leverage Existing Work:** Which uses most existing code/engines?
3. **Arbitrage Value:** Which has highest margin potential?
4. **Completion Probability:** Which has clearest path to finish line?

---
*The goal is to choose one project, finish it, and use it to validate both the technical arbitrage strategy and the modular SaaS factory approach.*

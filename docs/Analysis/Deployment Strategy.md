# Deployment Strategy

**Purpose**: To outline the strategy for deploying and maintaining the Business Intelligence SaaS application in a production environment. This document covers hosting, CI/CD, and operational considerations.

## Hosting Platform

- **Choice**: AWS (Amazon Web Services)
- **Rationale**: Provides a comprehensive suite of services, scalability, and reliability required for a production SaaS application. Offers a free tier for initial development and cost-effective scaling.

## Core AWS Services

- **Compute**: [[EC2]] for application servers, potentially [[ECS]] or [[EKS]] for containerized deployments as the application scales.
- **Database**: [[RDS]] (PostgreSQL) for managed database services, ensuring high availability and automated backups.
- **Caching/Queueing**: [[ElastiCache]] (Redis) for [[Sidekiq]] and [[Kredis]].
- **Storage**: [[S3]] for static assets and backups.
- **Networking**: [[VPC]] for isolated network environments, [[Route 53]] for DNS management, [[ALB]] (Application Load Balancer) for traffic distribution.
- **Monitoring**: Integration with [[CloudWatch]] for logging and metrics, complementing [[Sentry]] for application-level error tracking.

## Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)

- **Tool**: [[GitHub Actions]]
- **Pipeline Stages**:
    1.  **Code Push**: Triggered on every push to the `main` branch or pull request merge.
    2.  **Testing**: Run all [[Unit Tests]], [[Integration Tests]], and [[End-to-End (E2E) Tests]] as defined in the [[Testing Strategy]].
    3.  **Build**: Build the application artifacts (e.g., Docker images).
    4.  **Deployment**: Deploy the application to staging and then to production environments upon successful tests and manual approval.

## Production Environment Considerations

- **Security**: Implement strict [[Aegis]] policies, network security groups, IAM roles, and regular security audits.
- **Scalability**: Design for horizontal scaling of application servers and background job workers. Utilize AWS auto-scaling groups.
- **Monitoring & Alerting**: Comprehensive monitoring with [[Sentry]] and [[CloudWatch]] for application health, performance, and error rates. Set up alerts for critical issues.
- **Logging**: Centralized logging solution (e.g., CloudWatch Logs, or a dedicated logging service) for easy debugging and auditing.
- **Backups & Disaster Recovery**: Regular database backups (RDS automated backups), S3 backups for static assets, and a defined disaster recovery plan.
- **Cost Management**: Implement AWS cost explorer and budgeting tools to monitor and optimize cloud spending.

## Future Enhancements

- **Containerization**: Migrate to Docker and Kubernetes (EKS) for improved portability, scalability, and resource utilization.
- **Serverless Functions**: Explore [[AWS Lambda]] for specific, event-driven tasks to optimize costs and operational overhead.

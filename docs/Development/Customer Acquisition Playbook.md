# Customer Acquisition Playbook - Apex Analytics Platform

**Goal:** First paying customer by Week 8, $10k MRR by Month 6  
**Strategy:** Technical differentiation + transparent pricing + developer-first approach  
**Target:** Mid-market SaaS companies needing embedded analytics

## Week 1-2: Foundation While Building

### Build in Public Strategy
**Start immediately - don't wait for perfect product**

#### Daily Actions (5 minutes)
- [ ] Tweet one technical insight from development
- [ ] Share code snippet showing statistical capabilities
- [ ] Post progress update with screenshot

#### Weekly Actions (30 minutes)
- [ ] Write technical blog post about solving a problem
- [ ] Share on HackerNews, Reddit (r/SaaS, r/startups)
- [ ] Update LinkedIn with progress milestone

### Example Posts That Work
```
"Just implemented confidence intervals on ALL our regression outputs. 
Most BI tools: 'Here's a trendline ðŸ“ˆ'
Apex Analytics: 'Here's the trend with 95% confidence bounds showing 
exactly how certain you can be' 
Statistical rigor shouldn't be optional."

[Include code snippet or visualization]
```

## Week 3-4: Demo Preparation

### The "Wow" Demo Dataset
Create a dataset that shows clear statistical advantage:

1. **E-commerce A/B Test Dataset**
   - Control: 10,000 transactions
   - Treatment: 10,000 transactions  
   - Show: Proper statistical significance vs. naive comparison
   - Highlight: How competitors would show "5% improvement!" when it's not significant

2. **Sales Forecasting Dataset**
   - 2 years of daily sales data
   - Show: Confidence intervals on predictions
   - Highlight: "Know when forecasts are reliable vs. guessing"

3. **Multi-variate Analysis Dataset**
   - Marketing spend across 5 channels
   - Show: Actual attribution with confidence
   - Highlight: "Stop guessing which channels work"

### Demo Script (10 minutes)
```
1. The Problem (2 min)
   "You're making million-dollar decisions based on basic charts"
   Show competitor dashboard - just lines and bars

2. The Difference (3 min)
   "What if you knew HOW confident to be in your data?"
   Show same data with confidence intervals
   
3. The Statistical Edge (3 min)
   "Real A/B testing, not just comparing averages"
   Live demo of hypothesis testing
   
4. The Platform Advantage (2 min)
   "This runs YOUR brand, YOUR domain, YOUR customers"
   Show white-label capabilities
```

## Week 5-6: Direct Outreach

### Target Customer Profile
**Ideal Customer:**
- SaaS company with 50-200 employees
- $5M-$50M ARR
- Already has customers asking for analytics
- Technical founder or strong engineering culture
- Currently using basic charting library

**Where to Find Them:**
- ProductHunt launches (comment offering analytics help)
- SaaS Facebook groups and Slack communities
- IndieHackers forum
- Twitter #buildinpublic hashtag
- LinkedIn Sales Navigator

### Outreach Templates

#### Email Template 1: The Statistical Edge
```
Subject: Your customers can't tell if that 5% lift is real or random

Hi [Name],

Saw [Company] just launched [Feature]. Congrats! 

Quick question: When your customers see analytics in your app, can they tell 
if a 5% improvement is statistically significant or just noise?

We built Apex Analytics because every BI tool shows trends but none show 
confidence. Your customers are making big decisions on data they can't trust.

Takes 5 minutes to see the difference: [Demo Link]

Worth a quick call to discuss?

#### Email Template 2: The Pricing Pain
```
Subject: Analytics pricing that won't punish your growth

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company] is scaling fast - adding 50+ customers per month is 
impressive!

Are you dreading the analytics renewal? Most platforms punish growth with 
10x price jumps for more users.

Apex Analytics has transparent, usage-based pricing. No surprises. No 
user penalties. Calculator right on our website.

15-minute demo? I'll show you exactly what you'd pay at 10x your current 
scale.

Aaron
```

#### LinkedIn Message Template
```
Hi [Name] - Impressive growth with [Company]! 

Quick question: Are your customers asking for better analytics? 

We help SaaS companies embed PhD-level statistical analysis (think real 
confidence intervals, not just trendlines) while keeping it simple for 
end users.

Open to a quick chat about how [Competitor] customers switched to us for 
the statistical rigor?
```

## Week 7-8: First Customer Close

### Pricing Strategy for First 10 Customers

#### "Pioneer Pricing" (50% off for 12 months)
- Apex Platform: $475/month (normally $950)
- Professional: $900/month (normally $1,800)  
- Enterprise: $1,550/month (normally $3,100)

**In Exchange For:**
- Case study rights
- Monthly feedback call
- Reference for future customers
- Logo on website

### Objection Handling

**"We already use [Tableau/Looker/etc]"**
> "Those are great for YOUR team. But can you embed Tableau in your product for YOUR customers? And when you do, does it show confidence intervals on predictions? We're not replacing your internal BI - we're powering analytics for your customers."

**"It's too early/we're too small"**
> "Actually, that's perfect. Implement proper analytics now before your customers develop expectations. Our Pioneer Pricing makes it cheaper than a junior developer, and you get enterprise-grade analytics from day one."

**"We can build this ourselves"**
> "You absolutely could. It'll take 2 developers about 6 months and ongoing maintenance. Or you can have PhD-level statistics live next week for less than you spend on Slack. Plus, when's the last time your team implemented ARIMA forecasting with confidence bounds?"

**"How do we know you'll be around?"**
> "Fair question. Three answers: 1) We're profitable from day one with our model, 2) Everything runs on your infrastructure if you choose, 3) We're building in public - you can see our metrics and growth."

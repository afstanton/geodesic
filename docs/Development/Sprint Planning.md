## Risk Register Updates

### Technical Risks
1. **Multi-tenant complexity** - Mitigated by schema-based approach
2. **Statistical accuracy** - Mitigated by comprehensive testing
3. **Performance at scale** - Mitigated by early optimization

### Business Risks
1. **Customer acquisition timeline** - Mitigated by dual-track strategy
2. **Pricing resistance** - Mitigated by transparent model
3. **Competition** - Mitigated by statistical differentiation

### Mitigation Actions This Sprint
- Daily progress tracking
- Weekly demo to maintain momentum
- Customer feedback sessions every 2 weeks
- Technical debt review every sprint

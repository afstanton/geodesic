## Technical Decisions Log

### Week 1 Decisions
1. **Multi-tenancy:** Row-level isolation with acts_as_tenant (single schema)
2. **Stats Library:** Evaluating statsample vs custom implementation for Quant
3. **API Format:** REST with JSON API specification
4. **Authentication:** Devise + JWT for API authentication

### Pending Decisions
- [ ] Choose statistics library or build custom
- [ ] Select JavaScript framework for embeddable components
- [ ] Decide on caching strategy (Redis vs Memcached)
- [ ] Choose monitoring solution (Sentry, Datadog, New Relic)

## Risk Tracker

### Active Risks
1. **Statistical Implementation Complexity**
   - Impact: High
   - Probability: Medium
   - Mitigation: Start with simple implementations, iterate

2. **Multi-tenant Security**
   - Impact: Critical
   - Probability: Low
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive testing, security review

3. **Customer Acquisition Timeline**
   - Impact: High
   - Probability: Medium
   - Mitigation: Start outreach early, build in public

### Resolved Risks
- None yet

## Notes & Observations

### What's Working
- Documentation and planning are comprehensive
- Technical foundation is solid (Rails 8.0.2)
- Clear vision and strategy

### What's Not Working
- Implementation velocity needs to increase
- Need to move from planning to building faster
- Customer validation not yet started

### Adjustments Needed
- Less planning, more coding
- Set daily coding targets
- Start customer outreach immediately

# Marketing Analytics SaaS

**Project Codename:** Attribution Engine  
**Target Market:** Mid-market companies with $500k-$5M marketing spend  
**Revenue Target:** $800-4,000/month per customer  
**Development Timeline:** 4-6 months MVP, 12-24 months full MMM capabilities

## Strategic Overview

A progressive marketing analytics platform that starts with accessible attribution and spend optimization, then evolves into sophisticated Marketing Mix Modeling capabilities. This approach leverages Aaron's optimization background while avoiding the extended development timeline of building full MMM from the start.

### Technical Arbitrage Opportunity

Aaron's chemistry PhD (global optimization thesis) + Rails expertise creates unique advantages in:
- **Advanced statistical modeling** that most marketing tools lack
- **Econometric analysis** for true incrementality measurement
- **Multi-touch attribution algorithms** beyond basic last-click attribution
- **Predictive budget optimization** using mathematical optimization techniques

## Market Analysis Summary

**Total Addressable Market:** $46.4B (Marketing SaaS) growing at 15.5% CAGR  
**Competitive Landscape:** Clear gaps between basic tools ($100-500/month) and enterprise MMM ($3,000-10,000/month)  
**Customer Segments:** 50,000+ companies with sufficient marketing complexity to justify premium analytics

### Primary Competitors

**Basic Tier ($100-500/month):**
- Google Analytics 4 (free but limited)
- HubSpot Marketing Analytics ($800/month)
- Mixpanel ($25-833/month based on volume)

**Advanced Tier ($1,000-5,000/month):**
- Northbeam ($1,000-21,250/month) - attribution focus
- Sellforte (€2,990-€3,490/month) - MMM platform
- Traditional MMM consultancies ($10k-50k projects)

**Market Gap:** Sophisticated attribution + MMM-lite for mid-market companies who need more than basic analytics but can't afford enterprise solutions.

# Business Intelligence SaaS

**Project Codename:** Insight Engine  
**Platform Foundation:** Built on [[Apex Analytics Platform]]  
**Target Market:** Mid-market companies ($10M-100M revenue) needing advanced analytics  
**Revenue Target:** $1,000-3,000/month per customer  
**Development Timeline:** 3-5 months MVP (leveraging [[Apex Analytics Platform]] foundation)

**Project Context:** [[SaaS Factory Strategy]] | Platform: [[Apex Analytics Platform]] | Alternative: [[Catalyst]] | Analysis: [[SaaS Market Analysis: Marketing Analytics vs Business Intelligence]]

## Strategic Overview

Vantage is the **flagship implementation** of the [[Apex Analytics Platform]] - a mid-market Business Intelligence application that serves as both a revenue-generating product and proof-of-concept for the underlying platform's capabilities. This dual purpose creates powerful strategic advantages:

**As a Standalone Product**: Vantage differentiates through advanced statistical analysis capabilities rather than just data visualization, targeting the gap between basic dashboards and expensive enterprise analytics.

**As Platform Validation**: Vantage success demonstrates the [[Apex Analytics Platform]]'s capabilities to potential white-label customers, creating the ultimate social proof: *"This platform is so powerful, we built our own $15k+ MRR BI business on it."*

# New Rails Engines for Geodesic Projects

This directory contains documentation for new, custom Rails engines to be built for the Geodesic project. These engines are designed to fill functionality gaps not covered by existing open-source solutions and to be reusable across multiple SaaS applications, in line with the [[SaaS Factory Strategy]].

## Core Application Engines

- **[[Data Ingestion Engine]]**: Manages ETL processes, data source connections, and data mapping.
- **[[Statistical Analysis Engine]]**: Provides advanced statistical modeling and analytical capabilities.
- **[[Visualization Engine]]**: Powers interactive dashboards and complex data visualizations.
- **[[Alerting Engine]]**: Handles anomaly detection and user notification logic.
- **[[Security Engine]]**: Manages application-level security, roles, and permissions.
- **[[Optimization Engine]]**: Provides operations research and mathematical optimization capabilities.

# New Rails Engines for Geodesic Projects

This directory contains documentation for new, custom Rails engines to be built for the Geodesic project. These engines are designed to fill functionality gaps not covered by existing open-source solutions and to be reusable across multiple SaaS applications, in line with the [[SaaS Factory Strategy]].

## Core Application Engines

- **[[Conduit]]**: Manages ETL processes, data source connections, and data mapping.

- **[[Canvas]]**: Powers interactive dashboards and complex data visualizations.
- **[[Sentinel]]**: Handles anomaly detection and user notification logic.
- **[[Aegis]]**: Manages application-level security, roles, and permissions.
- **[[Optimus]]**: Provides operations research and mathematical optimization capabilities.

## Gateway Engines

- **[[Nexus]]**: Provides a standardized way to expose application functionality via APIs for third-party developers.
- **[[Synapse]]**: Offers a unified interface for integrating with various Machine Learning/AI Platform services.
- **[[Tally]]**: Provides a reusable, robust, and extensible engine for metering and calculating usage-based billing.

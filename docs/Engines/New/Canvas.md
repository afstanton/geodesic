- **ComponentTemplate**: Reusable component templates for white-label customers
- **CustomerTheme**: Tenant-specific branding and styling configurations
- **EmbedToken**: Secure tokens for embedding components in customer applications

### Statistical Integration
Deep integration with [[Quant]] engine for advanced visualizations:
- **Statistical Model Visualization**: Charts that represent complex statistical analyses
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Visual representation of confidence intervals and prediction bands
- **Hypothesis Testing Results**: Clear visualization of statistical significance and effect sizes
- **Multi-Variate Analysis**: Advanced charts for regression results and factor analysis

## White-Label Integration Patterns

### SDK Integration
```javascript
// Example: White-label customer embedding a chart
import { StatisticalChart } from '@yourplatform/analytics-sdk';

function CustomerDashboard() {
  return (
    <StatisticalChart
      type="confidence-interval"
      apiKey={customer.apiKey}
      dataSource="customer-metrics"
      theme={customer.brandTheme}
      onInteraction={handleChartInteraction}
    />
  );
}
```

### API-First Rendering
```javascript
// Generate chart via API for non-React applications
fetch('/api/v1/charts/render', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}` },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    type: 'regression-analysis',
    data: customerData,
    theme: customerTheme,
    format: 'svg'
  })
});
```

### iframe Embedding (Fallback)
```html
<!-- For customers who cannot use SDK integration -->
<iframe 
  src="https://customer.analytics-platform.com/embed/chart/12345"
  data-theme="customer-brand"
  data-auto-resize="true">
</iframe>
```

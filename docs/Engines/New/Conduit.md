# Data Ingestion Engine

**Purpose**: To provide a robust and extensible framework for extracting, transforming, and loading data from a variety of sources into the application's data warehouse with enterprise-grade security and customer data isolation.

**Related To**: [[Vantage]], [[Catalyst]], [[Aegis]]

## Core Features

- **Source Connectors**: A pluggable architecture for connecting to various data sources, including:
  - SQL Databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
  - NoSQL Databases (MongoDB)
  - Third-party APIs (Salesforce, Google Analytics)
  - File uploads (CSV, Excel)
- **Credential Management**: Securely store and manage credentials for data sources using customer-specific encryption.
- **ETL Job Management**:
  - Define and schedule recurring data ingestion jobs.
  - Monitor job status and logs.
  - Handle errors and retries.
- **Data Mapping**: A UI for mapping incoming data fields to the application's data model.
- **Data Validation**: Basic data validation and cleansing during the ingestion process.
- **Secure Data Processing**: Zero-trust data pipeline with encryption-first approach.
- **Customer Data Isolation**: Complete separation of customer data during ingestion and processing.
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging of all data access and processing activities.

## Security Architecture

### Secure ETL Pipeline
- **Immediate Encryption**: Raw data encrypted upon ingestion before any processing
- **Customer-Isolated Processing**: Each customer's data processed in separate, isolated environment
- **Encrypted Data Transformation**: Processing performed on encrypted data where possible
- **Secure Credential Storage**: Data source credentials encrypted with customer-specific keys
- **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail of data access, processing, and transformation

### Customer Data Isolation
- **Tenant Switching**: Automatic switching to customer-specific database schema
- **Isolated Storage**: Customer data never commingled in storage or processing
- **Separate Encryption Keys**: Each customer has unique encryption keys for their data
- **Network Isolation**: Data processing occurs in private, isolated network segments

### Data Processing Models
- **SecureETLPipeline**: Handles encrypted data extraction, transformation, and loading
- **CustomerDataIsolation**: Manages tenant switching and data separation
- **SecureCredentialStore**: Encrypted storage and retrieval of data source credentials
- **DataProcessingAudit**: Tracks all data processing activities for compliance

## Technical Design

- **Models**: `DataSource`, `Credential`, `IngestionJob`, `FieldMapping`, `SecureETLPipeline`, `DataProcessingAudit`.
- **Controllers**: Admin-facing controllers for managing data sources and jobs with security controls.
- **Jobs**: Background jobs (using [[Sidekiq]]) to perform secure ETL work in isolated environments.
- **Security Services**: Customer data isolation, encryption management, and audit logging.
- **Dependencies**: `Faraday` for API connections, `Sidekiq` for background processing, [[ETL]] gem for core processing logic, [[Aegis]] for security and encryption services.

## Competitive Security Advantages

- **Zero-Trust Data Pipeline**: Data encrypted and isolated from ingestion through analysis
- **Customer-Specific Encryption**: Each customer's data protected with unique encryption keys
- **Complete Data Isolation**: No possibility of customer data cross-contamination
- **Comprehensive Audit Trail**: Full compliance reporting and security monitoring
- **Secure by Default**: Security is built-in, not an add-on feature

## Implementation Phases

- **Phase 0**: Basic data ingestion with encryption (v0.1)
- **Phase 1**: Customer isolation and secure processing (v0.5)
- **Phase 2**: Advanced security features and compliance reporting (v1.0)
- **Phase 3**: Customer-controlled security policies and data governance (v1.5)

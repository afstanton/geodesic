# Security Engine

**Purpose**: To provide a centralized and reusable engine for managing application security, including authentication, authorization, data governance, and enterprise-grade data protection.

**Related To**: [[SaaS Factory Strategy]], [[Vantage]], [[Catalyst]]

## Core Features

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: A UI for defining roles and assigning permissions to them.
- **Data Governance**: Policies for controlling access to specific data sets or features based on user roles.
- **Audit Logging**: A comprehensive audit trail of all security-sensitive events.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Integration with MFA providers.
- **Enterprise Data Security**: Bank-grade encryption and data isolation for customer data.
- **Customer Data Isolation**: Complete separation of customer data using row-level multi-tenancy with `acts_as_tenant`.
- **Encryption Management**: Customer-specific encryption keys with automatic rotation.
- **Compliance Framework**: Built-in support for SOC 2, GDPR, HIPAA, and SOX compliance.

## Data Security Architecture

### Multi-Layer Encryption
- **Encryption at Rest**: All customer data encrypted in database using AES-256-GCM
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all data transmission
- **Application-Level Encryption**: Customer-specific encryption keys for additional protection
- **Field-Level Encryption**: Sensitive fields encrypted individually with separate keys

### Customer Data Isolation
- **Database Schema Isolation**: Each customer gets completely separate database schema
- **Customer-Specific Encryption Keys**: Unique encryption keys per customer, never shared
- **Zero-Trust Processing**: Data processed in encrypted form whenever possible
- **Network Isolation**: Private subnets with no direct internet access

### Security Models
- **CustomerEncryption**: Manages customer-specific encryption keys and rotation
- **SecurityAuditLog**: Immutable audit trail with cryptographic signatures
- **CustomerDataIsolation**: Handles multi-tenant data separation
- **SecureDataStore**: Encrypted storage with automatic encryption/decryption

## Technical Design

- **Models**: `Role`, `Permission`, `AuditLog`, `CustomerEncryption`, `SecurityAuditLog`, `CustomerDataIsolation`.
- **Controllers**: Controllers for managing roles, permissions, and security policies.
- **Authorization Adapter**: An adapter to integrate with an authorization gem like [[Pundit]].
- **Encryption Services**: Customer-specific encryption, key management, and rotation.
- **Compliance Services**: Automated compliance reporting and audit trail generation.
- **Dependencies**: [[Devise]] (Engine), [[Pundit]], [[Rolify]], `acts_as_tenant`, AWS KMS or HashiCorp Vault (key management).

## Competitive Advantages

- **Security-as-Differentiator**: Bank-grade security by default vs competitors' add-on security
- **Customer-Controlled Security**: Customers can set their own encryption policies and data retention
- **Built-in Compliance**: SOC 2 Type II, GDPR, HIPAA compliance framework included
- **Premium Pricing Justification**: Enterprise-grade security justifies higher pricing
- **Data Breach Prevention**: Multi-layer security prevents business-ending security incidents

## Implementation Priority

- **Phase 0**: Basic authentication and RBAC (v0.1)
- **Phase 1**: Customer data isolation and encryption (v0.5)
- **Phase 2**: Advanced audit logging and compliance reporting (v1.0)
- **Phase 3**: Customer-controlled security policies and data governance (v1.5)

# MCP Gateway Engine

**Purpose**: To provide a unified and abstracted interface for integrating with various Machine Learning/AI Platform (MCP) services, enabling seamless consumption and deployment of AI/ML models within the applications.

**Related To**: [[SaaS Factory Strategy]], [[Business Intelligence SaaS]], [[Marketing Analytics SaaS]], [[Technical Arbitrage Strategy]]

## Core Features

- **Platform Abstraction**: Abstract away the complexities and differences of various MCPs (e.g., AWS SageMaker, Google AI Platform, Azure ML).
- **Model Deployment & Management**: Tools for deploying, updating, and managing machine learning models.
- **Inference Endpoints**: Standardized way to call deployed models for predictions or insights.
- **Data Preparation Integration**: Connects with the [[Conduit]] to feed data to models.
- **Model Monitoring**: Track model performance, drift, and errors.
- **Version Control for Models**: Manage different versions of models.

## Technical Design

- **Models**: `MlModel`, `MlPlatform`, `InferenceRequest`.
- **Services**: Service objects to interact with external MCP APIs.
- **Integration**: Close integration with the [[Conduit]] for data pipelines and the [[Quant]] for model development.
- **Dependencies**: [[Faraday]] for general API communication, cloud-specific SDKs like `aws-sdk-ruby`, `google-cloud-ruby`, and `azure-sdk-for-ruby` for interacting with various MCPs, and LLM-specific gems like [[RubyLLM]], [[RubyLLM-MCP]], and [[RubyLLM-Schema]] for AI functionality.

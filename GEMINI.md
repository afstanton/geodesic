# GEMINI - AI Assistant Context for Geodesic Project

This document provides comprehensive context for AI assistants working with Aaron F Stanton on the Geodesic project. Read this file to understand the project's scope, constraints, and strategic framework before providing assistance.

## Project Overview

**Geodesic** is a systematic approach to building sustainable wealth through entrepreneurship, ultimately funding molecular nanotechnology research. The name refers to the shortest path between two points - Aaron's current state and his ultimate objectives.

## Person Profile

**Aaron F Stanton**
- Born: January 31, 1969 (age 56)
- Location: Indianapolis, Indiana (wants to relocate by end 2025)
- Education: Chemistry PhD, Purdue University (1999)
  - Thesis: Global optimization of functions
  - Background: Theoretical chemistry, molecular modeling
- Professional: 20+ years Rails/Ruby development experience
- Financial: Currently unemployed, negative net worth, $3k/month obligations

## Financial Context

**Current Reality:**
- No income, borrowing to pay bills
- $3k/month current obligations (not including living expenses)
- Need $6-7k net monthly for independent living post-relocation
- **Target: $10k gross monthly revenue by end of 2025**

**Ultimate Targets:**
- $1+ billion net worth
- Multiple global estates
- Molecular nanotechnology research funding
- Political goal: systematic anti-fascism work

## Strategic Framework

### Core Business Model: SaaS Factory
Aaron is building a modular system of Ruby gems and Rails engines that can be rapidly combined to create new SaaS applications. This contrasts with typical startups that rebuild everything from scratch.

**Key Advantages:**
- Faster time-to-market for new apps
- Compound improvements across portfolio
- Technical arbitrage through advanced skills
- Scalable wealth generation

### Technical Arbitrage Philosophy
Aaron's unique combination (chemistry PhD + optimization expertise + 20 years Rails) creates opportunities where advanced mathematical/statistical skills command premium pricing but remain scarce among developers.

**Primary Arbitrage Areas:**
- Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) - statistical complexity most developers can't handle
- Advanced business intelligence with sophisticated analytics
- Operations research and supply chain optimization
- Cross-platform integrations requiring deep technical knowledge

## Project Constraints & Preferences

### Absolute Requirements
1. **No consulting/contract work** - Aaron is burned out on working for others
2. **Proprietary code** - Will not license or give away engines/gems (his "secret sauce")
3. **SaaS only** - Must own the entire business model
4. **Fast revenue generation** - Needs cash flow ASAP for survival and relocation

### Market Validation Challenges
- Dislikes talking to potential customers for validation
- Distrusts verbal validation ("actions don't match words when payment time comes")
- Prefers technical validation over human interaction
- Pattern of starting projects but not finishing due to validation uncertainty

### Personality & Work Style
- Gets bored and frustrated quickly in traditional employment
- Pattern: race between being fired and finding new job
- Analytical, optimization-focused mindset
- Values technical excellence and sophisticated solutions
- Recognizes being "not like other people" as both strength and weakness

## Current Strategic Focus

**Primary Opportunity: Business Intelligence SaaS**
Based on comprehensive market analysis, targeting mid-market BI with advanced analytics capabilities.

**Why BI over Marketing Analytics:**
- Faster time-to-market (3-5 months vs 4-6 months)
- More predictable scaling with established per-user pricing
- Lower technical barriers but still leverages statistical expertise
- Clearer path to $10k MRR by end 2025

**Target Market:**
- Mid-market companies ($10M-100M revenue)
- Vertical focus: healthcare, financial services, manufacturing
- Companies needing sophisticated analysis beyond basic BI tools
- Budget range: $1,000-3,000/month per customer (need 5-10 customers)

## Previous Project Context

Aaron has multiple incomplete projects that represent both assets and challenges:

1. **Spindlet** - Cross-platform note-taking widget (stalled on DSL rewrite)
2. **Gaply** - Competitive SaaS analysis tool (stalled on data normalization)
3. **Ad-Optimizer** - Marketing management with MMM (discovered MMM pricing potential)

These projects provide existing code and engines but also represent the pattern of starting without finishing.

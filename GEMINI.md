# GEMINI - AI Assistant Context for Geodesic Project

This document provides comprehensive context for AI assistants working with Aaron F Stanton on the Geodesic project. Read this file to understand the project's scope, constraints, and strategic framework before providing assistance.

## Project Overview

**Geodesic** is a systematic approach to building sustainable wealth through entrepreneurship, ultimately funding molecular nanotechnology research. The name refers to the shortest path between two points - Aaron's current state and his ultimate objectives through **platform economics**.

**Current Status:** Strategic planning complete with platform-first architecture. Multi-tenant analytics platform (Apex) identified with dual revenue streams. Ready to begin platform development with Vantage as flagship implementation.

## Person Profile

**Aaron F Stanton**
- Born: January 31, 1969 (age 56)
- Location: Indianapolis, Indiana (wants to relocate by end 2025)
- Education: Chemistry PhD, Purdue University (1999)
  - Thesis: Global optimization of functions
  - Background: Theoretical chemistry, molecular modeling
- Professional: 20+ years Rails/Ruby development experience
- Financial: Currently unemployed, negative net worth, $3k/month obligations

## Financial Context

**Current Reality:**
- No income, borrowing to pay bills
- $3k/month current obligations (not including living expenses)
- Need $6-7k net monthly for independent living post-relocation
- **Target: $10k gross monthly revenue by end of 2025**

**Ultimate Targets:**
- $1+ billion net worth
- Multiple global estates
- Molecular nanotechnology research funding
- Political goal: systematic anti-fascism work

## Strategic Framework Evolution

### Core Business Model: Platform-First SaaS Factory
Aaron is building **Apex Analytics Platform** - a foundational multi-tenant platform that powers both his own applications and white-label implementations for other SaaS companies. This represents an evolution from building individual SaaS apps to creating platform infrastructure.

**Platform Advantages:**
- **Revenue multiplication** - Same platform serves multiple customer bases
- **Faster time-to-market** for new implementations
- **Compound improvements** across entire ecosystem
- **Technical arbitrage** leveraging PhD skills at platform scale
- **Platform economics** with network effects and ecosystem growth

### Technical Arbitrage Philosophy
Aaron's unique combination (chemistry PhD + optimization expertise + 20 years Rails) creates opportunities where advanced mathematical/statistical skills command premium pricing but remain scarce among developers.

**Market Validation:**
Based on comprehensive white-label market analysis, current platforms offer only \"basic trendlines, aggregates, and filtering\" with **zero competitors providing PhD-level statistical capabilities** (regression, A/B testing, confidence intervals, causal inference).

**Primary Arbitrage Areas:**
- Advanced statistical analysis as platform differentiator
- Multi-tenant architecture with bank-grade security
- Transparent pricing solving market's #1 pain point (75% abandon due to pricing complexity)
- SDK-first embedding enabling true native integration

## Project Constraints & Preferences

### Absolute Requirements
1. **No consulting/contract work** - Aaron is burned out on working for others
2. **Proprietary code** - Will not license or give away platform engines (competitive moat)
3. **Platform/SaaS only** - Must own the entire business model and infrastructure
4. **Fast revenue generation** - Needs cash flow ASAP for survival and relocation

### Market Validation Approach
- Platform approach reduces traditional validation needs
- Vantage serves as proof-of-concept for platform capabilities
- White-label market research validates demand and pricing
- Developer-focused market appreciates technical differentiation
- Social proof strategy: \"This platform is so powerful, we built our own $15k+ MRR BI business on it\"

### Personality & Work Style
- Gets bored and frustrated quickly in traditional employment
- Pattern: race between being fired and finding new job
- Analytical, optimization-focused mindset
- Values technical excellence and sophisticated solutions
- Platform approach provides continuous novelty and scaling challenges

## Current Strategic Focus

**Phase:** Implementation Sprint 1 - Multi-tenant foundation and Quant engine MVP
**Primary Architecture:** Apex Analytics Platform with Vantage flagship implementation
**White-Label Strategy:** Transparent usage-based pricing addressing market pain points
**Documentation Status:** Complete implementation suite including Sprint Planning, Quick Start Guide, Testing Checklist, and Revenue Tracking
**Development Status:** Rails apps created, engines scaffolded, ready for core implementation

### Apex Analytics Platform
**Target Market:** SaaS companies needing white-label embedded analytics
**Pricing Model:** 
- Starter: $950/month (100k API calls, 10GB processing, 5k sessions)
- Professional: $1,800/month (500k API calls, 50GB processing, 25k sessions)
- Enterprise: $3,100/month (2M API calls, 200GB processing, 100k sessions)
**Key Innovation:** Transparent usage-based billing with no hidden fees

### Vantage - Flagship Implementation
**Role:** Aaron's own branded BI application built on Apex platform
**Target Market:** Mid-market companies needing advanced analytics
**Pricing:** $1,000-3,000/month per customer
**Strategic Purpose:** Proof-of-concept and social proof for platform capabilities

### Revenue Projections
- **Month 6:** $2k-4k MRR (platform validation through Vantage)
- **Month 9:** $8k-15k MRR (first white-label implementations)
- **Month 12:** $20k-35k MRR (established platform with enterprise features)
- **Month 18:** $40k-75k MRR (ecosystem growth and network effects)

## Platform Architecture Understanding
